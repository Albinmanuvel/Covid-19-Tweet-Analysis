I do not understand how people are continuing to ignore serious risks of cardiovascular issues, blood clots, diabetes & more serious health risks from even mild cases of #COVID19. So many are going maskless & risking their lives, but still going to gym, eating organic, etc? WTH?
I should be able to keep the air in my own house safe. #COVID19 spreads in the air like smoke, when people breathe, talk, cough or sneeze and the virus can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours after an infected person leaves the room.
Wearing a high quality #N95 mask protects the wearer but only for about 2.5hrs if others around them are unmasked, and my baby can't wear a mask.
here is so much America is currently dealing with. Please don't forget that #COVID19 is not only still here but surging. BA 4 and BA 5 are serious threats. Please take precautions to protect yourself and others. #COVIDisAirborne #CovidIsNotOver
Vaccnation drive against #COVID19 helped prevent more than 42 lakh potential deaths in #India in 2021, according to a mathematical modelling study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal.
#India records 11,793 new #Covid19 infections, 27 deaths in last 24 hours; active case count rises to 96,700
Due to the surge in #COVID19 cases all across #india ,volunteers recall the importance of #covid19 preventive measures by creating awareness to fellow passengers travelling in @lthydmetrorail
think I recognise people at the 'they cannot control our bodies' protests as the same ones who were marching to force experimental vaccinations and useless masks on to everyone.
Hospital patients with #Covid19 have risen significantly in a week. Could it be any clearer now, #CovidIsNotOver? And for the avoidance of doubt, scientists & medics concerned about government's approach, have not been calling for a lockdown, just basic public health protections.
One of our children's grandparents now has #COVID19. I'm livid. And the doctors and nurses who may care for them aren't eligible for a 4th dose of #CovidVaccine. Still looking for a law firm that will take on the Ontario Ministry of Health for us. Open up boosters to everyone 18+
This may be a good time to tell peeps to please get vaccinated. Get your boosters & everything for #COVID19 I've been vaccinated & got my booster still got it because people are too lax about 'back to normal'. This is the new normal. Wear a mask & wash your hands!
Making a conscious choice to keep banging-on about the underplaying of #COVID19 health risks, whilst the same mistakes are being made again & again. Please don't ignore the rising wave of #BA4 until it's too late. You don't want your family members to be disabled by this virus.
I don't see how 1.7m (estimated) cases of #COVID19 last week in the UK suggests that anything is over, other than the last vestiges of the Govt pretending that they care about it.
I don't know of any unvaccinated ppl who had covid; all vaccinated had it. Mother of my girlfriend ended up in hospital after the booster, one girlfriend had blood clots in her lungs, one friend had a stroke.
COVID is on the raise again. Please don't self medicate . Wear a mask . Stay safe.
ust in case people are forgetting, COVID-19 hasnt gone anywhere, we cant just take these many deaths a day as normal and get on with our lives. Dont wait for the govt to take action, just wear a mask and get your booster!! #COVID19 #CovidIsNotOver #WearAMask #StaySafe #auspol
What rot. You only believe in freedom for #Women when it suits you. What about all the women you essentially made prisoners of the state when they refused #Covid19 vaccines? I didn't see you supporting their right to choose the best thing for their body then, Justin.
It is still shocking to me, 2.5 years into this pandemic, to read of people working in the #cancer field who believe that since they got #COVID19 that the #vaccines didn't protect them. The data is clear and we need to get the messaging right - #vaccines save lives.
Another friend of mine who has had the booster for #COVID19 just tested positive today.
You can get reinfected quickly from #COVID19. And reinfections may be significantly worse. Most of the US has high community transmission of COVID right now. Wear a mask. #WearAMask
I'm just a guy once again sitting in a room reading a lot of r/o Covid radiographs and a lot of persistent cough after Covid CTs wondering how anyone could delude themselves into thinking this is over, or done with or anywhere near finished with us. Keep your guard up.
"The more times you get it, the more likely you are to be unlucky and end up with long COVID - which is the thing that none of us want because it can be so serious."
With #India reporting more than 10K new #COVID19 cases daily for the past two weeks, experts urge govt to increase surveillance to probe the reason behind the surge
Triple-jabbed workers who have been infected by #Covid19 calling the #unvaccinated 'a threat' must surely be peak lunacy.
As a father-and Surgeon General -I'm am thrilled that every age group, 6 months & above, is now eligible to get protection from the #COVID19 vaccine. I encourage everyone to get vaccinated-it's the best way to protect our kids & all of us against the worst consequences of COVID.

I'm not a parent but I really feel for those sending their kids to schools with zero mitigations whilst knowing we could be doing plenty. Especially in the face of as yet unknown ramifications of repeat #COVID19 infections in kids. This is #SARSCoV2 #CovidIsNotOver #VaccinesPlus
28 June: Due to increased #COVID19 prevalence in its communities, increased ward outbreaks & impact on staff absence, @BetsiCadwaladris asking all staff, patients & visitors to wear face masks in all clinical areas in all health & care settings, unless exempt. #CovidIsNotOver
